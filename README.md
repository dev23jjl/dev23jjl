# 👋🏼 Hello! ¡Hola! Γεια σου!
## 👨🏼‍💻 I’m [@dev23jjl](https://github.com/dev23jjl) (or you can call me James)!

- #### 🌐 I'm a web developer and student who loves Nuxt JS and Atomic CSS (ex. Windi, Uno, and Tailwind)!
- #### 👀 I’m interested in learning more of how to use Nuxt JS to further my web development skills!
- #### 🌱 Currently learning ~~Greek~~ Ελλινικά (already know ~~Spanish~~ español). 
- #### 💞️ I can help with any project where my (meager amount of) skills could be used to help. I'm normally busy, but if you need my help - feel free to reach out to me.
- #### 📖 I want to learn other languages (whether spoken or programming)
- #### 🧠 I love to learn and often test out new software 😎
- #### 💻 Check out my website in development ~~at [23jjl.vercel.app](https://23jjl.vercel.app)~~ (currently not in development, but planning)
