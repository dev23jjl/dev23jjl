# 👋 Hello
### I’m @dev23jjl (or you can call me James)!
- 🌐 I'm a web developer and student who loves Nuxt JS and Windi CSS!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more of how to use Nuxt JS to further my web development skills and create awesome web apps!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in Java for a class.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where my skills could be used to help. I'm normally busy, but if you need my help - feel free to reach out to me.
- 📖 I want to learn other coding languages (like TypeScript 😎)
- 🧠 I love to learn and often test out new software (probably one of my largest distractions next to coding)
- 💻 Check out my website in development at [23jjl.vercel.app](https://23jjl.vercel.app)
